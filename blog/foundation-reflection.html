        <h2>Foundation Reflection:</h2>
        <h3>9 February 2025</h3>

        <p>
          <strong>
            ◦ What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your
            ego due to the Human Skills learning?
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Since starting this course, I have learnt a lot about how I approach
          problem solving and how I can often be a bit hard headed when faced
          with a difficult task. Asking for help is a key part of foundations
          and there are many methods we have been provided for reaching out when
          we struggle. This first example is something that I have gotten better
          at over the last 5 weeks but I still need to encourage myself to reach
          out when I hit a wall as there are plenty of people who can either
          help or may have experienced the same things.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have learnt how to examine myself and my strengths in order to apply
          them to the tasks that we have been given. This has given me the
          opportunity to reflect on how I behave under pressure and in turn try
          different problem solving techniques to see what I relate to or find
          effective. The Tic Tac Toe and Whack-a-Mole tasks have been the best
          examples of tasks that I found difficult but persevered through and
          completed as a result.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lastly, I have challenged myself to be strict and limit distractions
          during my studies. In the past, I have almost always had something
          going on in the background while I worked or relaxed as it acted
          almost as some form of white noise, but during the foundations part of
          the course, I have actively focused on limiting these distractions so
          that I can really absorb the information I'm trying to learn. Trying
          to unlearn these habits has been a challenge, but I feel as though I
          have benefited from having a focused mindset when it's needed most.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>
            ◦ What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in
            learning and programming?
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          As most employers in the industry care about how you will fit into or
          affect the culture of their workplace, learning the value of soft
          skills has been an important lesson.
        </p>
        <p>
          Values are an important part of your identity that show others what
          you consider important or meaningful. If your values align with the
          others you work with, it is far easier to get along with each other
          and build deeper relationships, which in turn makes it easier to work
          and collaborate together.
        </p>
        <p>
          Empathy is a vital soft skill that shows you are able to consider how
          others are thinking or feeling. In a learning or programming
          environment, this could look like recognising when someone is
          struggling or needing help and offering your assistance during this
          time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Self awareness is the ability to recognise your strengths or
          weaknesses and how that will affect the current or upcoming tasks you
          may be responsible for. This is the perfect opportunity to reach out
          and ask for help if you know you may need to learn the skills that are
          required for success of the task or offer your help if you believe you
          can lean into your strengths to provide your assistance.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>
            ◦ What has surprised you the most about the Human Skills learning?
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          I suppose what surprised me most about the Human Skills concepts was
          just how much focus was put on these learnings during each sprint. I'm
          sure this may be a common viewpoint held by students starting this
          course, but I expected the programming side to take up the majority of
          the sprint, with some time spent on Human Skills but it feels like
          more of a 50 / 50 approach.
        </p>
        <p>
          After spending some time with these concepts, I can definitely see the
          value that they hold and how they will be vital lessons to have learnt
          and be able to apply in a workplace.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>
            ◦ What were the most challenging aspects of the Human Skills
            learning?
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          I felt as though the hardest parts of the Human Skills learning was
          challenging any preconceived ideas I had around what these concepts
          meant or how they applied to me. Looking into my own strengths,
          identity and values, meant taking an honest look in the mirror and
          seeing where I could improve or learn more.
        </p>
        <p>
          After working a full time job for nearly a decade and deciding to come
          back to study, I knew there would be a shift in mentality studying a
          new subject that I knew little to nothing about, but I feel as though
          learning or relearning some of these soft skills was an aspect of this
          course that I didn't fully anticipate.
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>
          <strong>
            ◦ Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much
            time focusing on Human Skills learning in a web development Bootcamp
            course?
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Learning to code is obviously a very big part of becoming a web
          developer, but if that's all there was to getting a job in this field,
          Dev Academy would likely focus more on that as the curriculum. It has
          been said already, but employers are not looking for the most
          efficient or technical programmer when they go through the hiring
          process, they are more interested in whether you'll be a good fit for
          their businesses culture and that means having the right social and
          soft skills.
        </p>
        <p>
          Technical ability can be taught but social soft skills are not
          something they want to have to teach their employees, it's much more
          appealing for them to find candidates who already meet these ideals.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>
            ◦ Does the time you spent studying Human Skills learning here feel
            like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to
            practise programming instead?
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          I think focusing on and learning how to cultivate these soft skills is
          a good method to break up the technical material in a way that is
          complimentary. If we were only ever learning the coding material, it
          would likely be overwhelming and would not provide the opportunity to
          sit with a topic for a while before moving onto the next technical
          skill.
        </p>
        <p>
          I certainly don't feel like having the Human Skills portion of the
          course has been a waste, as I have still been given plenty of
          opportunities to learn and practice coding subjects. I also feel like
          the pace of each sprint has slowly ramped up over time while
          maintaining a good balance of technical and human skills. If the
          course was solely technical skills from the start, it would be much
          more difficult for new students who are completely fresh to a lot of
          these subjects, such as myself.
