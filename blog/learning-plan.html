        <h3>16 January 2025</h3>

        <p>
          <strong>1. What is your long term goal or career pathway?</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          I would like to develop my skills in this area to the point where I am
          a competent web developer, able to look for work in a position that
          provides me growth opportunities and the ability to turn my learnings
          into a long term career.
        </p>
        <p>
          I understand that often means starting at the bottom as an entry level
          or junior developer and working your way up, but I am committed to
          doing so if that is what it takes.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong
            >2. A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to
            learning</strong
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          My strengths are in my interests and dedication to throw myself into
          whatever I am doing. I often find myself going down the rabbit hole as
          it were relating to things that I am interested in but I view this as
          a strength as I tend to come out of it learning more about that topic
          than if I only skimmed the surface. Learning how to dial that back to
          be at the level where I learn enough about a topic to move forward
          confidently but not overdoing it will be a key strength I will develop
          over my time at Dev Academy.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have been doing computer based work for the better part of a decade
          at this stage so my computer literacy is already decent and will only
          get better the more I practice the lessons put in front of me.
        </p>
        <p>
          My limitations are potentially in my attention span, this could be
          something that becomes evident if I ever miss a deadline or go over a
          time box for instance. As mentioned above, I tend to get really
          invested in particular topics so if I am not managing my time
          effectively and attempting to stick to the designated time given for a
          particular task, then I could see this being an issue.
        </p>
        <p>
          These last two weeks have been a really good test for sticking to the
          time box of a given topic and I have been pretty successful at not
          overdoing it but this is something I will be trying to stay on top of.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong
            >3. What skills (non-technical/human skills) would you like to see
            developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</strong
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          I would like to work on my collaborative skills, working as part of a
          team and working effectively with others to meet deadlines or
          objectives.
        </p>
        <p>
          For a very long time in my professional life, I have been doing self
          directed and rather isolated work. In my previous job, I was the only
          person who did the particular function that my role served so there
          were little to no opportunities to work with others on the same
          project or piece of work. This was pretty isolating but I also
          developed skills relating to being self-directed and self-motivating
          as if I didn’t do that work, then it wouldn’t get done.
        </p>
        <p>
          I would like to develop my soft skills more to be an effective
          communicator and team player so that I am prepared for entering a web
          developer role and the requirements that position would have in this
          regard.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong
            >4. A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this
            programme.</strong
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          I know that I am responsible for my own learning and managing my own
          workload is very important if I want to be successful in this course.
          I am committed to completing what is requested of me to the deadlines
          that I have been provided.
        </p>
        <p>
          In order to do this effectively I will be very strict with limiting
          anything that could potentially distract me and during “work time”
          only focusing on the tasks that I have set for myself. This will
          become even more important when we begin to work collaboratively with
          others, so I will do my best to be respectful and helpful to other
          students or facilitators in the course.
        </p>
        <p>
          I promise to reach out to the facilitators or other students if I am
          struggling with any of the content as the most effective way to combat
          these problems will be relying on others who are more knowledgeable
          than myself. This will also help me to develop my relationships during
          my studies and prepare me for the networking that will become a large
          part of professional life in this space.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong
            >5. A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely
            way</strong
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          I have been familiar with discord for a number of years now, thanks to
          my friends and I using it as a social hub for catching up virtually,
          sharing messages or memes and for voice chat while gaming.
        </p>
        <p>
          This means that if I am struggling with any work in the course, I know
          that I will be able to seek help in the discord from the Facilitators
          or other students. I commit to utilising this resource effectively and
          when in need rather than struggle with a problem for a prolonged
          period of time.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong
            >6. A description of what you expect from the Facilitation
            team</strong
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          The faculty of Dev Academy have been incredibly welcoming and open,
          clearly demonstrating their knowledge and expertise in the areas of
          study that we are engaging with.
        </p>
        <p>
          My expectation is that this will continue and they will make
          themselves available to us whenever we have questions or issues. I
          expect that when we are in person during the bootcamp, they will be
          just as accessible and friendly allowing us to thrive in this
          environment by fostering our development & growth.
        </p>
        <p>
          I look forward to building my relationships with them over the course
          of the next 6 months and what I will learn from them in the process.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong
            >7. Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are
            committed to other things.</strong
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          I have been incredibly lucky to have the full support of my wife who
          has taken on the responsibilities and burden of being the sole earner
          in our house for the time that I am studying. This has been to
          alleviate any of these stresses for me so that I can focus entirely on
          my studies.
        </p>
        <p>
          As such, at the end of last year, I resigned from full time work to
          become a student and thankfully don’t have any scheduling commitments
          that would interfere with my learning plan, meaning I will be
          available every day throughout the week.
        </p>
        <p>
          That said, if something unexpected comes up last minute like a doctors
          appointment or something similar, I will reach out to the facilitators
          or my cohort to let them know as soon as possible.
