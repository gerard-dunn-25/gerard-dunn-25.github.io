      <h3>9 January 2025</h3>

      <p>‚ÄùGerry has a focused, quiet strength. He doesn't get overwhelmed by a problem, rather analyses the situation with a zen-like attitude to overcome. All the meanwhile staying positive and optimistic. He's thoughtful, generous, full of heart and will treat you with patience and understanding should your worlds collide.‚Äù</p>
      <p><em>- Daniel Bartlett (Friend)</em></p>
      <p><strong>1. Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.</strong></p>
      <p>Thankfully I haven‚Äôt had too many run ins with ethical decision of any significant importance but one of the clearest ones I can think of was finding a lost wallet on the street that had a decent amount of cash in it. I was able to track down it‚Äôs owner and returned the wallet with all of the money still in it.</p>
      <p>The owner was very grateful and while it would have been pretty easy to say that I found the wallet but the money was no longer inside as someone might have already taken it, I stuck to my values and was honest in this situation which made me feel good about doing a good deed. I tend to think about how I would feel in that situation and act according to how I hope others would also act.</p>
      <p><strong>2. Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your values and identity.</strong></p>
      <p>I was born and raised in Auckland, New Zealand and I come from a half Kiwi, half Irish family. My Mum is Irish and was a midwife for the majority of her working career. Dad is Kiwi and worked in Mediation & Arbitration, often dealing with very sensitive information or challenging relationships between two parties while helping them to come to a mutual understanding or agreement before further legal proceedings are required.</p>
      <p>Both of my parents worked in jobs that were very demanding of them on their interpersonal skills and as a result of this, they made a concerted effort to instil these skills in my sister and I. They value empathy, honesty, kindness & loyalty which are values that I strive to adhere to in my own life.</p>
      <p>Both my parents are also very musical, with my Mum singing in several choirs along with learning how to play the ukulele, while my dad has played guitar and bass for many years, playing in multiple bands over the years.</p>
      <p>This all rubbed off on me as I learned how to play the guitar as well from a young age, eventually joining a band myself which was a highlight of my 20‚Äôs. At our peak, we got signed to an American label when we released our full length album and we did a small tour in Australia. The band split after 2018 when our vocalist decided he wanted to leave the band. Since covid I haven‚Äôt been playing as much as I would like but know that it‚Äôs there for me whenever I decide to invest more time into it.</p>
      <p>Shortly after this, I met the person who I am now lucky enough to call my wife, and we have been helping each other grow ever since. She is my rock and encourages me in everything that I do. She is very much responsible for helping me decide to move on from my previous job and return to study which is why I am here now.</p>
      <p><strong>3. Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning journey.</strong></p>
      <p>According to the DOPE test, I received the Owl outcome which says that I am detail oriented, often perceived as a perfectionist and am somewhat risk averse.</p>
      <p>In the Strengths quiz, my top strengths are Humanity, Wisdom & Courage.</p>
      <p>The Big 5 test suggests I am open and agreeable.</p>
      <p>These strengths will help me during my learning journey as they will allow me to be critical of the tasks and challenges that are presented to us throughout the course.</p>
      <p>I will be able to ask for help with it is needed as this is a great way to minimise the risk associated with going in the wrong direction or misunderstanding something.</p>
      <p>I will be able to connect with other students during my studies as building relationships will be a vital part of networking in the industry and what better place to start practicing these skills than right here, right now.</p>
      <p>I will be open to new ideas while challenging the things I thought I knew, and learning from others as we try to make the most of the flipped learning / classroom dynamic.</p>
      <p><strong>4. Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career development. How might these affect your learning journey?</strong></p>
      <p>For the last 8 years, I was working in multiple positions for Auckland Council in the food registration and licensing space.</p>
      <p>This was a great opportunity and Council was an excellent employer to have over Covid when job security was a big issue, especially with their flexibility on working from home.</p>
      <p>The issue I ran into after spending 6 years in my last role was that the position provided limited career development and I couldn‚Äôt see myself developing in that space.</p>
      <p>Given that I am now about 10 years out from my last studies and qualifications, I do feel like there will be a bit of rust to shake off as I return to study. This may mean that I am a little slow to pick up certain concepts but I hope that working in a professional setting for the better part of the last decade will set me in good stead to continuing to learn and develop.</p>
      <p><strong>5. Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.</strong></p>
      <p>During my first degree, I studied at AUT for a Bachelor of Business in Marketing and Advertising. The only problem which I later came to realise is that I have no interest in these topics!! As part of all tertiary and school environments, an emphasis is often made on completing certain assignments in a group. Given that the topic is marketing and advertising, you‚Äôd think that people would be comfortable with talking or ‚Äúselling‚Äù their idea to a group of people. Unfortunately, that is not always the case and certainly affected me during a few of my group assignments.</p>
      <p>One notable presentation I can remember required a group of 4 - 5 people to each contribute to the assignment and present their section to the class. My group consisted of myself and several people who either English was their second language or they were too nervous to speak in front of the class. They all refused to present their sections and considering I still wanted to achieve a decent grade for the assignment, I was left to fend for myself or be marked down if their sections weren‚Äôt shown.</p>
      <p>I tried to encourage them all to give it a try but could not convince them to get involved. As a result, I chose to present the entire presentation myself while the other members of my group simply stood at the front of the class and occasionally pointed at the board when their sections were being shown.</p>
      <p>While my attempts to encourage my other group members were largely ineffective, I think I would encourage them in different ways if I were to be put back in that same position again. I would try to emphasise how they are responsible for their own learning and that they will only truly learn by doing these things themselves, not having someone do it for them.</p>
