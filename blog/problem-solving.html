        <p>
          I had a good opportunity this week to try out many different problem
          solving methods and I will be ranking them out of 5 stars to show my
          level of confidence with each technique. <strong>★★★★★</strong>

            <strong>Pseudocode: </strong><strong>★</strong>
            <em>
              I would say this is one of the areas that I need to work on most
              as I barely used any Pseudocode during this weeks sprint, likely
              to my own detriment. I certainly need to practice this more.
            </em>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Trying something: </strong><strong>★★★★</strong>
            <em>
              Now this is a method I used a lot, and I mean <em>A LOT</em>.
              Trying things and seeing what the result was worked for me in a
              lot of instances but when it became a difficult task, this method
              has it's pitfalls.
            </em>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Rubber ducky method: </strong><strong>★★★★</strong>
            <em>
              This method for me was pretty useful, I would often explain
              problems to my wife and while saying it out loud, the path forward
              would often come into focus. I can see this being a technique I
              will use a lot in future as well.
            </em>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Reading error messages: </strong><strong>★★</strong>
            <em>
              Error messages are still something that I am getting used to.
              While I can see how they would be invaluable in certain
              circumstances, a lot of my experience with them was having a hard
              time truly interpreting what it was they were trying to tell me.
              What this has shown me however is the importance of writing
              effective tests.
            </em>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Console.logging: </strong><strong>★★★★★</strong>
            <em>
              I am very fond of using a console.log as this is basically the
              most immediate feedback I've been able to get when testing things
              out. If I try something new, I console.log it. Did it work? Great,
              now I can figure out how to move onto the next step or incorporate
              it into my solution. If not? Even better, now I can rule something
              out that doesn't work. Strong recommend.
            </em>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Googling: </strong><strong>★★★</strong>
            <em>
              This method definitely feels like a double edged sword. On the one
              hand, the problem that your facing has probably been encountered
              time and time again by other developers and they've taken to the
              internet in the same way you are now looking for answers. On the
              other hand, their problem may be a little more unique or specific,
              so their solution may not be a one size fits all fix. I have had
              mixed results with this technique but what it has taught me was
              the benefits of extrapolating the right information from something
              online and applying the parts of it that are relevant to my own
              problem.

            <strong>Asking your peers for help: </strong><strong>★★</strong>
            <em>
              This one seems like one that will get easier over time as we build
              our relationships with one another and in the process improve our
              confidence. Asking for help in this way often felt like admitting
              defeat when it really shouldn't have. I tend to feel like asking
              for help from the discord should be easier, but feeling
              embarrassed about the complexity of the problem I was facing often
              meant I would try solve it some other way first until I was
              properly stumped.

          <li>
            <strong>Asking coaches for help: </strong><strong>★★★</strong>
            <em>
              I feel a bit better about asking the facilitators for help as it
              is their role to provide us with guidance and support.
              Interestingly I am not sure why this feels different as though it
              is free from judgement compared to asking peers for help but maybe
              this is something that I will come to terms with over time. I have
              no reason to believe my peers would judge me in this way as they
              have been nothing but friendly and supportive so I think it's more
              my frame of mind that needs to adapt.

            <strong>Improving your process with reflection: </strong
            ><strong>★★★</strong>
            <em
              >Reflecting on my progress has been an interesting journey. I
              haven't ever used a journal or a diary in the past, so it has been
              a learning curve for sure. The benefit that I have noticed has
              been that I am thinking more deeply about the events of the day by
              the time it comes to the reflection part which has resurfaced what
              I was thinking or feeling during the task. This feels like it
              helps the new information to stick and reinforces what I learned
              that day, so I can imagine it will only get better with practice.
