        <h2>Problem Solving:</h2>
        <h3>31 January 2025</h3>
        <h3>◦ A time where I was blocked on a simple problem:</h3>
        <p>
          During the gradebook exercise, I was feeling pretty confident. I had
          seen in Discord that other students had experienced issues with this
          task, and right up until the averages section, I had been able to
          figure out the solutions (with some help from google of course).
        </p>
        <p>
          At this point, I had correctly solved the average function and only
          had to utilise this function in order to apply it to an individual
          students scores.
        </p>
        <p>For whatever reason, I had written my function as:</p>
        <pre>
              function getAverage(studentName) {
                gradebook[studentName].testScores = average(scores)
                console.log(gradebook)
              }
            </pre
        >
        <p>
          At this point I had been working through too many of the kata without
          a break, and this was causing me to sit and stare at this problem for
          far too long. I had tried to console.log the result to see what it was
          doing and I wasn't getting anywhere with it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Instead of bashing my head against a wall, I chose to ask for help in
          the discord and was immediately helped out by another student and a
          facilitator. They pointed out two (now obvious) issues. First that I
          was not returning any result and second that I wasn't calling the
          function correctly.
        </p>
        <p>
          with these tips in mind, I reorganised my code to return the average
          function from the previous task, specifying the student whose scores I
          wanted to average.
        </p>
        <pre>
            function getAverage(studentName) {
              return average(gradebook[studentName].testScores)
            }
        </pre>
        <p>
          Everything I needed to get the correct result was already there, I
          just had it in the wrong order and was missing the key piece of the
          puzzle which was to actually "return" something.
        </p>
        <h3>◦ How I elegantly solved a problem:</h3>
        <p>
          One problem I solved elegantly (or at least in my own opinion), was
          the capitalise task. We were asked to take each word in a string,
          capitalise each word individually using a map, then return each word
          back to a string.
        </p>
        <p>
          Because I initially struggled with this task, I had a look at the
          other tasks to see if I could solve them first and come back to this
          one after. After finally solving the deBee task, I had learned a few
          things that I was able to apply to this problem.
        </p>
        <p>
          My first attempt to solve this problem ran into a couple of problems.
          I was using the split, map, join builtin functions that I had become
          more familiar with during the deBee task. By altering the split and
          join parameters, I was only able to target the first character in the
          entire string, or the entire first word of the string. At this stage
          my code was:
        </p>
        <pre>
            function capitalize(string) {
              return (
                string
                  .split(' ')                  
                  .map((char, index) => (index === 0 ? char.toUpperCase() : char))
                  .join(' ')
              )
            }
        </pre>
        <p>
          At this point I realised I was probably overcomplicating the process,
          so I went to our trusty friend google to look at how to capitalise one
          word to see if I could insert that into my function. Sure enough there
          was a pretty straightforward method to apply this to one word, so I
          amended my previous code to implement this new approach.
        </p>
        <pre>
          function capitalize(string) {
            return (
              string
                .split(' ')
                .map((element) => element.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + element.slice(1))
                // .map((char, index) => (index === 0 ? char.toUpperCase() : char))
                .join(' ')
            )
          }
        </pre>
        <p>
          This approach was successful which made me very happy, so happy in
          fact, my wife heard me from the next room as I shouted about my
          success! By selecting element, I was applying my function to each
          entire word as it mapped through the array, rather than going into
          unnecessarily deep detail and causing further issues. This approach
          leaned into the KISS approach (Keep it simple stupid).
        </p>

          ◦ Reflect on how confident you feel using each of these
          problem-solving techniques/processes:
        </h3>
        <p>
          I had a good opportunity this week to try out many different problem
          solving methods and I will be ranking them out of 5 stars to show my
          level of confidence with each technique. <strong>★★★★★</strong>

            <strong>Pseudocode: </strong><strong>★</strong>
            <em>
              I would say this is one of the areas that I need to work on most
              as I barely used any Pseudocode during this weeks sprint, likely
              to my own detriment. I certainly need to practice this more.

              Now this is a method I used a lot, and I mean <em>A LOT</em>.
              Trying things and seeing what the result was worked for me in a
              lot of instances but when it became a difficult task, this method
              has it's pitfalls.

            <strong>Rubber ducky method: </strong><strong>★★★★</strong>
            <em>
              This method was pretty useful for me, I would often explain
              problems to my wife and while saying it out loud, the path forward
              would often come into focus. I can see this being a technique I
              will use a lot in future as well.

            <strong>Reading error messages: </strong><strong>★★</strong>
            <em>
              Error messages are still something that I am getting used to.
              While I can see how they would be invaluable in certain
              circumstances, a lot of my experience with them was having a hard
              time truly interpreting what it was they were trying to tell me.
              What this has shown me however, is the importance of writing
              effective tests.

            <strong>Console.logging: </strong><strong>★★★★★</strong>
            <em>
              I am very fond of using a console.log as this is basically the
              most immediate feedback I've been able to get when testing things
              out. If I try something new, I console.log it. Did it work? Great,
              now I can figure out how to move onto the next step or incorporate
              it into my solution. If not? Even better, now I can rule something
              out that doesn't work. Strong recommend.

            <strong>Googling: </strong><strong>★★★</strong>
            <em>
              This method definitely feels like a double edged sword. On the one
              hand, the problem that you're facing has probably been encountered
              time and time again by other developers and they've taken to the
              internet in the same way you are now looking for answers. On the
              other hand, their problem may be a little more unique or specific,
              so their solution may not be a one size fits all fix. I have had
              mixed results with this technique but what it has taught me was
              the benefits of extrapolating the right information from something
              online and applying the parts of it that are relevant to my own
              problem.

            <strong>Asking your peers for help: </strong><strong>★★</strong>
            <em>
              This one seems like one that will get easier over time as we build
              our relationships with one another and in the process improve our
              confidence. Asking for help in this way often felt like admitting
              defeat when it really shouldn't have. I tend to feel like asking
              for help from the discord should be easier, but feeling
              embarrassed about the complexity of the problem I was facing often
              meant I would try solve it some other way first until I was
              properly stumped.

            <strong>Asking coaches for help: </strong><strong>★★★</strong>
            <em>
              I feel a bit better about asking the facilitators for help as it
              is their role to provide us with guidance and support.
              Interestingly I am not sure why this feels different as though it
              is free from judgement compared to asking peers for help but maybe
              this is something that I will come to terms with over time. I have
              no reason to believe my peers would judge me in this way as they
              have been nothing but friendly and supportive so I think it's more
              my frame of mind that needs to adapt.

              a learning curve for sure. The benefit that I have noticed has
              been that I am thinking more deeply about the events of the day by
              the time it comes to the reflection part, which has resurfaced
              what I was thinking or feeling during the task. This feels like it
              helps the new information to stick and reinforces what I learned
              that day, so I can imagine it will only get better with practice.

        <h3>
          ◦ Reflect on a time you were reluctant to ask for help. Consider what
          made you reluctant to do so. What might you try differently next time?
        </h3>
        <p>
          There have been many times I have been reluctant to ask for help,
          largely because I viewed the problem I was having as something that
          shouldn't be that difficult and I should be able to figure it out
          myself. The problem being simple meant that asking for help felt like
          the easy way out and that I should put a little more effort into
          problem solving. I have seen other students asking for help with
          problems and the way I interpreted that was often "Yes, that looks
          like a problem worth asking for help over, whereas my problem seems
          simpler than that, I should be able to solve it myself".
        </p>
        <p>
          This is likely a detrimental mindset to be in as we are all learning
          at the moment (even if we all have different levels of understanding
          in these topics) and me asking for help is providing someone else an
          opportunity to practice what they have learned by helping to teach me.
        </p>
        <p>
          In future, I will likely ask for help more often when I get stuck as
          the few times I have done it, I've been put on the right path a lot
          sooner than I got there by trying to solve it myself. This is the
          flipped classroom concept in action, and I now see the importance in
          asking for help from more than just the facilitators as we will all
          learn more by working together rather than individually.
