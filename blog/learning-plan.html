        <h2>THS01 - Revised Learning Plan:</h2>
        <h3>23 March 2025</h3>

        <h3>
          <strong>Part I - Reflect</strong>
        </h3>
        <p>
          <strong>
            How accurate were your foundations expectations of your learning
            needs and growth areas?
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          I would say that my foundation expectations were pretty close to the
          actual reality of life during bootcamp but I simply didn't know how
          difficult some of the topics would be or how involved the human skills
          deep dives would be for the wider course. Looking back over my initial
          learning plan and my follow-up before bootcamp started, it's clear
          that I had an open mind and was willing to seek growth through
          learning and that has now become one of my main focuses when we look
          at our most important needs.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>
            Were there any surprises / did you learn new things about yourself?
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          This whole course so far has been learning a lot of new things about
          myself but also reinforcing the things I already knew about my
          character, which represent who I am as a person. In my previous
          learning plan, I talked about wanting to focus on interpersonal and
          communication skills, which is something that I have definitely done
          during bootcamp. I have received positive encouragement around this in
          the form of other students vocalizing how much they enjoy working with
          me or like me as a person and also these same sentiments being
          expressed to me by both the technical and human skills facilitators .
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>
            What challenges/barriers did you find in following your learning and
            wellbeing plan? How might you overcome some of these barriers as you
            proceed through the rest of your time in bootcamp?
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          For the challenges or barriers that I have faced, it has primarily
          been about the physical wellbeing aspects which directly affect mental
          wellbeing. Sticking to a structured routine with a consistent bedtime
          has been a real challenge as I tend to struggle with sleep, but it
          often results in me have very poor rest and ending up being overly
          tired during class. This has not been conducive to effective learning
          and I've certainly had to revisit certain lectures if there are parts
          I think I've not fully engaged with. As we're getting to the business
          end of the course, these next few weeks are going to be super
          important to show up to feeling rested and ready to go, so I'm going
          to be enforcing a much stricter bedtime in order to combat this
          challenge.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>
            What benefits did you experience from following your learning and
            wellbeing plan?
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          The primary benefit I found from following my learning plan was the
          feeling of being accountable to yourself. It is often the case that
          when you say you're going to do something or act in a certain way,
          unless it's in writing, things can be fluid and not adhered to without
          much risk of feeling like you're going back on your word. When it IS
          in writing however, you feel much more obliged to follow through on
          the things you said you would do or the ways you said you would act. I
          have found this to be very beneficial for me as I like to think that I
          am a pretty consistent person, but seeing that the things I wrote down
          in my learning plan are very much the ways that I have been conducting
          myself during this course has been reassuring and validating.
        </p>

        <!-- Part Two - Adapt your Wellbeing plan to reflect any new understanding you have gained during your bootcamp experience so far.

You have likely learnt some things and faced some challenges during your bootcamp experience so far that you may not have been able to predict during foundations.
This competency asks you to consider how you might apply these learnings to adapt your wellbeing plan so that you are best positioned to support your wellbeing, alongside your learning, through the rest of bootcamp. 
We will talk about Oranga / Wellbeing in a Human Skills Deep Dive during bootcamp to deepen thinking around this topic. 
If you have missed this deep dive please contact your HS tutor to catch up on the key concepts covered. -->
        <h3>
          <strong>Part II - Adapt</strong>
        </h3>
        <p>
          <strong>
            Te Whare Tapa Whā: Are any of the walls of my whare in need of
            strengthening? How might I do this?
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          In my whare, the Taha Tihana (physical wellbeing), could certainly use
          some improvement or strengthening. As mentioned above, I have been
          struggling with getting adequate sleep which can be improved with a
          more strict bedtime routine, but I have also been struggling with some
          injuries. My back has been causing me a lot of grief over the last few
          weeks and it's gotten to the point of seeing my GP with a referral for
          physio and the next step is getting in touch with a physio or an
          osteopath in order to resolve some of these pains.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>
            What are some of my key needs at the moment and are there some
            strategies I could try for meeting these needs?
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          As touched on in my reflection, Growth is one of if not my more
          important perceived need. In my previous job, I felt as though things
          had started to stagnate with progression of my skills and career
          development which was the driving force behind me coming back to do
          further study. Being in the Dev Academy course has only strengthened
          my need for growth and brought it to the forefront of my mind when
          considered what needs I have. Growth is something that can be pretty
          easily measured which is great as I am already able to refer back to
          where I was before and during foundations to compare it with where I
          am now which displays heaps of growth with the amount of content we've
          already learned.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>
            What does my stress profile look like? What does stress look like
            externally (how might others tell)?  What does it feel like
            internally (how might you know)? What do you need when you notice
            you are stressed?
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          When stressed, I get brain tension, where it feels like there is a net
          constricting everything and preventing things from relaxing or feeling
          unencumbered. I get unable to let a thing go or remove it from my
          train of thought until it has been addressed or resolved. I recognise
          these times by my internal dialogue not wandering which is fairly
          normal for me, instead it hyper-fixates on this issue.
        </p>
        <p>
          I tend to get fairly short with people and quite easily say things
          that I don’t entirely mean or could have said in a less direct or
          cutting way when I'm stressed. This doesn’t happen often for me and I
          feel as though I have pretty good coping mechanisms but when I do act
          out in this way it is very obvious to those around me as it is very
          out of character.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I notice I am stressed, I need to breathe and think about the
          plan of action to alleviate these feeling or recognise them in order
          to act in a way that is more in line with my character and values.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>
            What’s a wellbeing experiment I can try over the next few weeks
            (this doesn’t have to be a grand time consuming gesture, it could be
            something small like taking a few deep breaths before opening your
            computer).
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          I have found mindfulness and yoga during my time in this course to
          both be very beneficial ways to combat a lot of these stress
          responses. Having time set aside during class to do these activities
          has been a great asset to me and my mental wellbeing and an experiment
          I can try in the coming weeks is to continue these practices at home,
          particularly when I am feeling stressed or in need of some calm.

        <h2>Bootcamp Learning Plan:</h2>
        <h3>9 February 2025</h3>

        <p>
          <strong> 1. What is your long term goal or career pathway? </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          My long term goals are to build upon the knowledge I gain during the
          Dev Academy course and pave a pathway to a job in the web development
          industry as I believe this is a career that I can be enthusiastic
          about which is a significant change from where I was in my past jobs.
          Until recently, I had been working full time in a job that was enough
          to pay the bills but didn't challenge me or develop my professional
          skills in any meaningful way so I see this opportunity as a chance to
          accomplish both of those outcomes at the same time.
        </p>
        <p>
          While I'm still studying, I'd love to build upon the foundations that
          these last 5 weeks have provided me while enjoying the learning
          process. I expect that Bootcamp will be a pretty significant change
          from foundations, so I want to make sure to stay focused but still
          enjoy myself while we delve deeper into the key parts of the course.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>
            2. What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be
            in Bootcamp?
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          My biggest strengths will hopefully be my interpersonal skills, as I
          would love to build stronger relationships with the people I have met
          during foundations. Interacting in person will be a new dynamic and I
          think it will be a better opportunity to work with other students and
          network with people who will likely end up working in the same field
          as me.
        </p>
        <p>
          I feel like I have a pretty competent grasp on the concepts that we
          have covered during foundations so I'm hoping I will be able to hone
          my skills and draw on this knowledge during Bootcamp. Being able to
          ask people for help or guidance in person will also be a more
          effective way to reinforce a lot of this knowledge as interacting
          through discord has been very convenient but I feel like face to face
          interactions will be more memorable.
        </p>
        <p>
          My limitations will still be based on how reluctant I am to ask for
          help, as I will likely still want to solve things for myself at first.
          This is something I have definitely gotten better at over the course
          of Foundations but I will certainly need to identify how long is too
          long to be stuck on any one problem given the accelerated pace of
          Bootcamp.
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>
          <strong>
            3. What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at
            Bootcamp will be?
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          I am expecting that we will have to do group or paired tasks like the
          pair programming so the biggest challenge may be related to a
          difference of opinion between myself and other students. I don't see
          this as being too much of a problem as we are all learning and healthy
          debate over how to complete a task will result in us researching a
          topic more thoroughly. I certainly don't want to insult or upset
          anyone though, so being kind and thoughtful when having these types of
          conversations will be important to bear in mind as we all hold
          different perspectives.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also want to manage my time well and make sure that I am submitting
          all my work within the expected timeframes. I have been pretty good at
          this during foundations but I don't want my standards to slip if the
          material we are working with becomes more complex.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>
            4. What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see
            developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          My reflective skills could likely be an area that I would like to work
          on as I want to be thinking meaningfully about the work we are doing
          in order to let it resonate and stick in my long term memory. This is
          an experience that I am choosing to undergo as someone in their 30's,
          so I want anything I do during the course to be considered and have an
          impact on the learning experience I go through.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not that this is something that I have actively put myself through in
          the past, but my partner and people at my previous job, often talked
          about my leadership potential. This is certainly something that I
          could foster and develop during the Bootcamp portion of the course if
          the opportunity presents itself.
        </p>
        <p></p>

            5. What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          I expect that the Bootcamp team will be able to help us inspect our
          code and point us in the right direction if we need guidance. I am
          looking forward to getting to meet and know these people over the
          course of the next 9 weeks and that they will be open to answering
          questions we may have about the content we are learning as we go.
        </p>
        <p>
          I expect that support will cover both technical and human skills
          learnings and will help us develop these skills in order to prepare us
          for a job in the industry. Support in this way may be pointing us in
          the direction of interesting or important article and resources.

            6. What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          I will strive to reach out for assistance as soon as I am struggling
          with any content that I find difficult and will be in an environment
          where other students or staff are within arms reach, so to speak, so
          there should be no significant barrier.
        </p>
        <p>
          I commit to working through the workload requirements to the best of
          my abilities in a timely fashion, this includes any projects that are
          group oriented and therefore hold myself accountable to the others I
          am working with. I promise to be respectful of those around me, both
          staff and students, and that I will do my best to be mindful of the
          shared spaces that we are all operating in.

        <h2>Foundation Learning Plan:</h2>
        <h3>16 January 2025</h3>

        <p>
          <strong> 1. What is your long term goal or career pathway? </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          I would like to develop my skills in this area to the point where I am
          a competent web developer, able to look for work in a position that
          provides me growth opportunities and the ability to turn my learnings
          into a long term career.
        </p>
        <p>
          I understand that often means starting at the bottom as an entry level
          or junior developer and working your way up, but I am committed to
          doing so if that is what it takes.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>
            2. A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to
            learning
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          My strengths are in my interests and dedication to throw myself into
          whatever I am doing. I often find myself going down the rabbit hole as
          it were relating to things that I am interested in but I view this as
          a strength as I tend to come out of it learning more about that topic
          than if I only skimmed the surface. Learning how to dial that back to
          be at the level where I learn enough about a topic to move forward
          confidently but not overdoing it will be a key strength I will develop
          over my time at Dev Academy.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have been doing computer based work for the better part of a decade
          at this stage so my computer literacy is already decent and will only
          get better the more I practice the lessons put in front of me.
        </p>
        <p>
          My limitations are potentially in my attention span, this could be
          something that becomes evident if I ever miss a deadline or go over a
          time box for instance. As mentioned above, I tend to get really
          invested in particular topics so if I am not managing my time
          effectively and attempting to stick to the designated time given for a
          particular task, then I could see this being an issue.
        </p>
        <p>
          These last two weeks have been a really good test for sticking to the
          time box of a given topic and I have been pretty successful at not
          overdoing it but this is something I will be trying to stay on top of.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>
            3. What skills (non-technical/human skills) would you like to see
            developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          I would like to work on my collaborative skills, working as part of a
          team and working effectively with others to meet deadlines or
          objectives.
        </p>
        <p>
          For a very long time in my professional life, I have been doing self
          directed and rather isolated work. In my previous job, I was the only
          person who did the particular function that my role served so there
          were little to no opportunities to work with others on the same
          project or piece of work. This was pretty isolating but I also
          developed skills relating to being self-directed and self-motivating
          as if I didn’t do that work, then it wouldn’t get done.
        </p>
        <p>
          I would like to develop my soft skills more to be an effective
          communicator and team player so that I am prepared for entering a web
          developer role and the requirements that position would have in this
          regard.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>
            4. A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this
            programme.
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          I know that I am responsible for my own learning and managing my own
          workload is very important if I want to be successful in this course.
          I am committed to completing what is requested of me to the deadlines
          that I have been provided.
        </p>
        <p>
          In order to do this effectively I will be very strict with limiting
          anything that could potentially distract me and during “work time”
          only focusing on the tasks that I have set for myself. This will
          become even more important when we begin to work collaboratively with
          others, so I will do my best to be respectful and helpful to other
          students or facilitators in the course.
        </p>
        <p>
          I promise to reach out to the facilitators or other students if I am
          struggling with any of the content as the most effective way to combat
          these problems will be relying on others who are more knowledgeable
          than myself. This will also help me to develop my relationships during
          my studies and prepare me for the networking that will become a large
          part of professional life in this space.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>
            5. A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely
            way
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          I have been familiar with discord for a number of years now, thanks to
          my friends and I using it as a social hub for catching up virtually,
          sharing messages or memes and for voice chat while gaming.
        </p>
        <p>
          This means that if I am struggling with any work in the course, I know
          that I will be able to seek help in the discord from the Facilitators
          or other students. I commit to utilising this resource effectively and
          when in need rather than struggle with a problem for a prolonged
          period of time.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>
            6. A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          The faculty of Dev Academy have been incredibly welcoming and open,
          clearly demonstrating their knowledge and expertise in the areas of
          study that we are engaging with.
        </p>
        <p>
          My expectation is that this will continue and they will make
          themselves available to us whenever we have questions or issues. I
          expect that when we are in person during the bootcamp, they will be
          just as accessible and friendly allowing us to thrive in this
          environment by fostering our development & growth.
        </p>
        <p>
          I look forward to building my relationships with them over the course
          of the next 6 months and what I will learn from them in the process.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>
            7. Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are
            committed to other things.
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          I have been incredibly lucky to have the full support of my wife who
          has taken on the responsibilities and burden of being the sole earner
          in our house for the time that I am studying. This has been to
          alleviate any of these stresses for me so that I can focus entirely on
          my studies.
        </p>
        <p>
          As such, at the end of last year, I resigned from full time work to
          become a student and thankfully don’t have any scheduling commitments
          that would interfere with my learning plan, meaning I will be
          available every day throughout the week.
        </p>
        <p>
          That said, if something unexpected comes up last minute like a doctors
          appointment or something similar, I will reach out to the facilitators
          or my cohort to let them know as soon as possible.
