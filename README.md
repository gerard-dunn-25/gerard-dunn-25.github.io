# Welcome to the README file for [**my blog!**](http://gerard-dunn-25.github.io)

I will be documenting my progress here as an overview of my time at **Dev Academy**:

### About me:

I am a guy in my early 30's trying to figure out where my career could take me if I focused on things that **_actually_** interest me.

I have been working full time for the better part of the last decade (**YIKES**) and thought it was a good time to go back to study and learn about Web Development as it seems like a career that I can really sink my teeth into. 

I **_love_** my pets and here are a couple photos of them:

_This is my French Bulldog 'Indie' when she was the Ring Bearer for our Wedding!_

_This is my cat Guts, the night before we had to put him in a cattery while we were away for the Wedding!_

**Anyway**, back to the actual reason we're here. Below is how things have been progressing:

## Topics covered _so far_:

- **Sprint 1**: _Command line, Git & Github_ 
- **Sprint 2**: _HTML & CSS + adding them to your Blog_ 
- **Sprint 3**: __ 

##### More to come...!
