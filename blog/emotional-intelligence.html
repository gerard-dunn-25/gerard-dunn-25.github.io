          Emotional Intelligence:</h2>
      <h3>20 January 2025</h3>

      <h3>    ◦ What is Emotional Intelligence?</h3>
      <p>Emotional Intelligence refers to ones ability to interpret, assess, control and express emotions. This is important for identifying how you or others feel, what is being felt, communicating with others on a deeper level and practicing empathy by viewing things from other peoples point of view. EQ directly affects things like relationships, self awareness, empathy and motivation.</p>
      <p>In the past, IQ was seen as the best way to predict someone’s possibility for success in their social status, income level and learning ability. But over time EQ has been understood to also have a large impact on a persons ability to excel in academic achievement, career advancement, job performance and leadership effectiveness.</p>
      
      <h3>    ◦ How is EQ different to IQ?</h3>
      <p>EQ is different to IQ in that it is about emotional and social intelligence rather than a way of measuring someone's cognitive ability. Where IQ measures a persons ability to use logic, reasoning and knowledge to determine their mental ability, EQ is more about their ability to relate, socialise effectively, control their mood and identify emotions in themselves & others.</p>
      <p>While both EQ and IQ are valuable to grow and improve, EQ will be seen as a more important factor if people want to get to know you or hire you for a job. Skills can be taught or you can be trained for a job, whereas social skills will be the first thing that people notice when they talk to you and it’s important to make a good first impression when trying to make friends or apply for a job.</p>

      <h3>    ◦ Why is EQ important?</h3>
      <p>Emotional intelligence directly affect how you are perceived by those around you, especially in the workplace but also in your personal life. If you are able to relate to others while being kind, understandable and thoughtful, you are far more likely to be seen in a positive light than if you are extremely technically competent but a pain to work with or be around.</p>
      <p>For these reasons EQ is a vital aspect to develop and grow in order to be seen as a good candidate for a role in order to fit within a companies “culture”. You may think you are the “smartest person in the room”, but if you are not able to communicate effectively and display your social skills in a positive way, you are less likely to be seen as a good fit for the job you might be applying for. In your personal life, you are more likely to make long lasting relationships if you are an approachable, friendly and empathetic person.</p>
