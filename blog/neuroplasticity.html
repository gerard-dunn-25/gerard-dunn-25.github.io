        <h2>Neuroplasticity</h2>
        <h3>
          ◦ Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits
          people.
        </h3>
        <p>
          Neuroplasticity is a vital part of any attempt to learn something new.
          Your brain has the capacity to assist or resist this process and that
          ultimately comes down to how you choose to view the situation. You
          could choose to lean into learning something new, knowing that you
          will only grow if you challenge yourself and practice what you are
          learning repeatedly until it clicks. You could also view the process
          as too difficult based on your current level of intelligence or
          ability to understand the material, thinking that it is beyond your
          capability and therefore you will not be able to achieve or learn
          something new in this example. These are the fundamental differences
          between a Growth or a Fixed Mindset.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since the concept that the brain becomes fixed after a certain age has
          been challenged, we now know that the brain never stops adapting in
          response to learning. Neuroplasticity relies on a person holding a
          Growth Mindset, as that is what allows them to truly gain the benefits
          afforded to this mindset. When a person understands that their brain
          is both malleable and able to expand from their efforts, they are far
          more likely to engage with new and challenging experiences as they
          view these opportunities as a chance to grow and build themselves up.
          On the opposite side of the coin, people who believe that they are
          already as intelligent or competent as they will ever be, don’t afford
          themselves an opportunity to grow and tend to fall back into the
          habits that got them to where they are presently.
        </p>
        <h3>
          ◦ Discuss how you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity
          for your benefit.
        </h3>
        <p>
          When studying a new profession or learning a new topic, you give
          yourself an immense head start by simply being in the right frame of
          mind. By believing that you will have the ability to learn something
          new even (and especially) if it is challenging, you are already in a
          better position than someone who is not willing to engage with this
          challenge as you will view the experience as a chance to grow and
          expand your mind.
        </p>
        <p>
          My approach to engaging with the principles of Neuroplasticity is to
          view the experience of learning how to code and become a Web Developer
          as a challenge that I will be able to achieve if I apply enough
          dedication and effort. While it may be hard and I won’t get everything
          right away, by practicing the parts that I find difficult repeatedly,
          I will build connections in my brain that make the process or activity
          become second nature over time. I am making a concerted effort to be
          patient with myself and taking note of the parts of the course that I
          find engaging as this is an important factor that will help keep my
          motivation levels up.
        </p>
        <h3>◦ What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</h3>
        <p>
          There are many ways you can increase your neuroplasticity but the key
          thing that a lot of these ways have in common is that they are
          typically about trying or learning something new. By opening your mind
          up to new experiences, you are creating and reinforcing new pathways
          in your brain that are strengthened by repetition. You could:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Learn a new language</li>
          <li>Learn how to play an instrument</li>
          <li>Learn a new sport</li>
          <li>Learn to Juggle</li>
          <li>Listen to new music</li>
          <li>Try using your non-dominant hand to do a task</li>
          <li>Prioritise getting enough sleep</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          While the last point on the list is not new, getting enough sleep is
          one of the ways you can take care of your body in a physical manner
          that will affect your mental performance. Physical exercise is also
          useful in a similar way as it helps you to form new neurons & prevent
          neuron loss in a part of the brain which impacts memory retention.
        </p>
        <p>
          During this research, I found the article
          <a
            href="https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-brain-plasticity-2794886"
            >"How Neuroplasticity Works"</a
          >
          from Very Well Mind to be informative and engaging as it helped me
          understand Neuroplasticity from a biology standpoint.
        </p>
        <h2>Growth Mindset</h2>
        <h3>◦ Discuss what it is and why it is relevant.</h3>
        <p>
          A growth mindset is akin to the famous quote “it’s not about the
          destination, it’s about the journey”. In this way, a growth mindset
          places more importance on the effort (the journey) you put in to get a
          particular output (the destination). It suggests that even if you do
          not get the correct output, so long as you put effort into solving the
          problem, you will have learned from the process and that will affect
          your future attempts.
        </p>
        <p>
          A growth mindset, as mentioned above, is the mental state in which a
          person believes that they are able to grow and build their knowledge
          allowing their brain to expand and build new neural pathways when it
          receives new information. This is opposite to a fixed mindset which
          supposes that a persons intelligence and ability is fixed when they
          reach a certain developmental age and cannot be changed or improved.
        </p>
        <h3>
          ◦ In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?
        </h3>
        <p>
          During this research, I have started to gain an appreciation for how
          many different factors are related to having a growth mindset, such as
          your physical & mental health (exercising and getting adequate sleep),
          your willingness to engage with new experiences (learning a new sport,
          language or instrument) or your capacity for asking for help.
          Mindfulness can also play a role in aiding the growth mindset as when
          you are aware of your surroundings and how you fit into this
          environment, you are able to move with purpose.
        </p>
        <p>
          For me, the main change that I have noticed in the way I view this is
          how each of these factors are individual components, but they all
          combine into the whole which is having a growth mindset. Like
          anything, with practice comes competency and while practice may not
          make perfect, under the growth mindset, practice makes permanent.
        </p>
        <h3>
          ◦ How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?
        </h3>
        <p>
          My goal during this course is to be open and willing to learn new
          concepts even if they appear daunting at first. I know that there will
          be others who are more familiar with these topics and it will be all
          too easy to fall into the trap of comparing my progress to that of the
          other students. My challenge will be to view this as an opportunity to
          ask for help rather than feel less competent, as I may be able to
          learn from them and their experiences. So long as I am learning new
          things and putting my effort and dedication into practicing these
          learnings, I will achieve the goals I set for myself.
        </p>
        <p>
          For this topic, I found the article
          <a
            href="https://theeducationhub.org.nz/an-introduction-to-growth-mindset-2/"
            >"An introduction to growth mindset"</a
          >
          from The Education Hub to be useful as it helped me to solidify the
          concept and how it relates to my own situation.
        </p>
        <h2>Integrate these concepts into your Learning Plan:</h2>
        <h3>
          Reflect and discuss how these understandings may shape or influence
          your learning plan and strategy.
        </h3>
        <p>
          Upon reading my Learning Plan again, it is pretty reassuring to see
          that I have demonstrated some evidence of having a growth mindset.
          This will be an ongoing mentality that I will have to maintain during
          my time at Dev Academy and beyond, but there will be effective ways I
          can practice this throughout the course.
        </p>
        <p>
          Learning how to code is a difficult challenge and there will be
          concepts that are very foreign to me. By being honest and open about
          when I am struggling to understand a concept, I will be able to gain
          help from the combined knowledge of other students and the
          Facilitators to help me during these times.
        </p>
        <p>
          Repetition will also be another valuable method to implement into my
          own learning as I will gain confidence through my demonstrated ability
          to do or complete a particular task. By repeating the task or topic
          that we are learning at any given point, I will be building neural
          pathways in my brain that make engaging these tasks become second
          nature and will learn through the practical process of doing rather
          than just reading or viewing.
        </p>
        <p>
          By practicing these values and being open to learning or trying new
          experiences, I will be building a growth mindset as well as my
          knowledge about Web Development. This will help me communicate with
          others in the course, properly engage with the material we are
          learning in each sprint or bootcamp and allow me to succeed by viewing
          the process of learning as a vital step in achieving the desired
          outcome.
